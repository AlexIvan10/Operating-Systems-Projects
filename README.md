# Operating Systems Projects

This repository contains three projects developed for the Operating Systems course at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. Each project focuses on a key aspect of operating systems, covering topics such as file handling, processes and threads, and virtual memory management.

## Project 1: File Handling

In this project, the focus is on working with files at a low level using system calls. Key features include:

- Opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
- Implementing basic file manipulation utilities.

## Project 2: Processes and Threads

The second project delves into concurrent programming, exploring process and thread management. Key features include:

- Creating and synchronizing processes and threads.
- Managing race conditions and ensuring thread safety with synchronization mechanisms.

## Project 3: Virtual Memory and IPC

The third project covers virtual memory management and advanced inter-process communication techniques. Key features include:

- Implementing memory allocation and management techniques.
- Using pipes and shared memory for IPC.
- Handling page faults and simulating virtual memory behavior.
